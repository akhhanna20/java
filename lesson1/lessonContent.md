## Subsections

### Brief History of Java

Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere. This characteristic, along with its object-oriented nature, made Java a popular language for building distributed applications.-NEW
